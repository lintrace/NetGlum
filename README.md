# NetGlum

Long ago, when Windows XP operating system has been installed on all computers in our organization, we are amused by sending each other short text messages from computer to computer through the net send command.
When a message is received on another computer user can see not only the message, but also the real name of the sending computer in a local network.
This app allows you to make sending a message with the name of any computer as the sender.
